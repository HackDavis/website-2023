    question: 'What is a hackathon?',
    answer: (
      <>
        A hackathon is where you transform your crazy ideas into real projects.
        Hundreds of students from across California form teams around an idea
        and collaboratively create technical solutions to problems we face in
        our local communities. These ideas turn into websites, mobile apps,
        hardware, and more!
        <br />
        <br />
        Join HackDavis to make some of the most imaginative projects alongside
        fellow creators! You take care of building and we&apos;ll take care of
        you.

    question: 'Do I need to know how to code?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Nope! Coming in, you do not need to know how to code, but you have to be
        willing to learn! HackDavis is proud to be a beginner-focused hackathon,
        and we welcome hackers from all experience levels and backgrounds - over
        40% of our hackers are beginners! HackDavis is the perfect time and
        place to learn new skills - we host beginner-friendly workshops and our
        mentors provide guidance to help you build something you can be proud
        of.

    answer: (
      <>
        Teams can have up to four members, and submit a single project together!

    question: 'How can I help?',
    answer: (
      <>
        HackDavis is largely built upon the efforts of our mentors and
        volunteers, who ensure that our hackers have a great experience at our
        event! Our mentor and volunteer applications will open in late April, so
        keep an eye out! If you&apos;re interested in making a tax-deductible
        contribution to HackDavis, please get in touch at{' '}

    question: 'Why social good?',
    answer: (
      <>
        We want our attendees to create projects with a meaningful impact and
        hope to foster a community dedicated to social change. We find that most
        hackathons often don&apos;t result in projects as practical solutions to
        specific societal problems and we&apos;re looking to change that.

  {
    question: 'What can I build?',
    answer: (
      <>
        You can build whatever your heart desires, whether it&apos;s a web app,
        mobile app, hardware hack, open source tool, or even a simple website!
        Any social good oriented project is recommended. Our main focus is to
        provide you a learning experience where you can have fun, ask questions,
        and experiment with technology.

    question: "What if I don't have a team or idea?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Worry not! We will host a series of mixers before HackDavis, so check
        out our social media for announcements about those as we get closer to
        the event. We&apos;ll also have a final mixer right after hacking starts
        during HackDavis, so we&apos;ll make sure you&apos;re equipped and ready
        to go!
        <br />
        <br />
        Our non-profit partners, sponsors, and mentors are always here at the
        event to help you brainstorm and ideate if you don&apos;t have an idea!

    answer: (

        Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. HackDavis is free for all admitted participants,
        so don&apos;t sweat it! We will provide your WiFi, meals, caffeine,
